A smart parking system mini-project is an automated solution for managing a limited number of parking spaces. The core of this system is a microcontroller, such as an Arduino , which acts as the central processing unit. This device is programmed to monitor the number of available parking spots and control a servomotor that functions as the gate.  The system uses ultrasonic sensors placed at the entrance and exit points to detect vehicles. As a vehicle enters, the entrance sensor triggers the microcontroller to decrement the count of available spots. Conversely, when a vehicle leaves, the exit sensor signals the microcontroller to increment the count. This real-time tracking ensures the system always has an accurate count of available spaces.

The system's logic is straightforward yet effective: if the number of available slots is greater than zero, the microcontroller commands the servomotor to open the gate, allowing a vehicle to enter. Once the gate closes and the vehicle has passed, the system updates the spot count. However, if the count reaches zero, the system prevents the gate from opening, effectively blocking new vehicles from entering. This prevents overcrowding and ensures that no more vehicles enter than the lot can handle. The project often includes visual indicators like an LCD screen and LED lights to provide a user-friendly interface. A red LED might light up when the lot is full, while a green LED indicates availability. The LCD screen can display the real-time number of empty spots, providing drivers with a clear indication of the lot's status. This project is a practical example of applying sensor integration, actuator control, and basic automation logic to solve a common urban problem
